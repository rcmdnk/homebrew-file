Installation
============

Install Homebrew-file with Homebrew::

    $ brew install rcmdnk/file/brew-file

or you can use install script::

    $ curl -o install.sh -fsSL https://raw.github.com/rcmdnk/homebrew-file/install/install.sh
    $ chmod 755 ./install.sh
    $ ./install.sh
    $ rm -f install.sh

which installs Homebrew itself, too, if it is not installed.

Then, add following lines in you **.bashrc** or **.zshrc** to wrap ``brew`` command::

    if [ -f $(brew --prefix)/etc/brew-wrap ];then
      source $(brew --prefix)/etc/brew-wrap
    fi

Or, for Fish Shell add the following lines in your **config.fish** to wrap ``brew`` command::

    if test -f (brew --prefix)/etc/brew-wrap
      source (brew --prefix)/etc/brew-wrap.fish
    end

**brew-wrap** wraps the original ``brew`` command
for an automatic update of **Brewfile** when you execute
such a ``brew install`` or ``brew uninstall``.

.. note::

  21/Sep/2017 update

  The default place of Brewfile has been changed from::

      ~/.brewfile/Brewfile

  to::

      ~/.config/brewfile/Brewfile

  If ~/.config/brewfile/Brewfile doesn't exist but ~/.brewfile/Brewfile exists,
  ~/.brewfile/Brewfile is used as default Brewfile.

.. note::

  17/Dec/2015 update

  The default place of Brewfile has been changed from::

      /usr/local/Library/Brewfile

  to::

      ~/.brewfile/Brewfile

  because Homebrew deletes files under **/usr/local** other than
  Homebrew's one when such ``brew update`` is executed.
  (Homebrew checkout its repository as **/usr/local**.)

  If you used an old default setting (**/usr/local/Library/Brewfile**), you might lose Brewfile.

  In such case, please try ``brew file init`` and chose local Brewfile, which makes
  new file **~/.brewfile/Brewfile**.

  If you used git repository, you might see a output when you executed ``brew update``::

      $ brew update
      Ignoring path Library/rcmdnk_Brewfile/
      To restore the stashed changes to /usr/local run:
        `cd /usr/local && git stash pop`
        Already up-to-date.

  In this case, please delete **/usr/local/Library/<your_git_account>_Brewfile**,
  then do ``brew file set_repo``.

  New repository will be checked out to **~/.brewfile/<your_git_account>_Brewfile**.
