    # Scan runs on ubuntu, mac and windows
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        # We must fetch at least the immediate parents so that if this is
        # a pull request then we can checkout the head.
        fetch-depth: 2
    # Instructions
    # 1. Setup JDK, Node.js, Python etc depending on your project type
    # 2. Compile or build the project before invoking scan
    #    Example: mvn compile, or npm install or pip install goes here
    # 3. Invoke ShiftLeft Scan with the github token. Leave the workspace empty to use relative url
    # If this run was triggered by a pull request event, then checkout
    # the head of the pull request instead of the merge commit.
    - run: git checkout HEAD^2
